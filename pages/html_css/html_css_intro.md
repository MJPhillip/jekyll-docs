## Introduction

There are three main languages of front-end development: namely HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

    HTML controls content
    CSS manages styling
    JavaScript manages interactivity

Throughout this course, we will look at HTML in more detail and learn exactly how to use it when creating a website.

A few notes about HTML:

    HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.
    Any website you visit has been created with the use of HTML.
    Ever webpage is an HTML file.
    It is the backbone of website creation and therefore a relatively easy concept to learn.
    HTML is made up of short codes typed into a text-file by the creator of a site. These codes are known as tags.
    When the text is saved as an HTML file and opened by a browser, such as Google Chrome, the browser translates the text into the webpage that was intended to be created.

## Code Editors

Because HTML is written as text, a program as simple as Notepad (PC) or TextEdit (Mac) can be used. Yet, these have very limited functionality. They don’t offer things such as syntax highlighting and error spotting in your code.

We recommend using VS Code as your code editor. It is a popular choice for front-end developers. We also suggest plugins such as Prettier, which automatically formats your code for you and Live Server which allows you to code on one screen and have the browser automatically update on another screen as you work.

Other code editors include Atom, Brackets and Sublime.

If you already have a code editor you prefer, you’re welcome to use that. INFO

Tip: Try using a dark theme with less contrast. This can be less tiring on your eyes than a white theme. This is personal preference though, so try different options to see what works best for you.
