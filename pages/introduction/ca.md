To get you excited about your first year of Front-end Development and give you an insight into the sorts of things we’ll be doing on the programme, we’ve created an introduction video showing you the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. You can watch the video below and see the code from the video in a GitHub repository:

This is it - the end of the introduction course. Remember if you have any questions about how, what or when to deliver - please use your class channel on Discord or digital classroom.

Relax, this time it is just about gathering a few of those things you've already (or should have!) done earlier this module.

## 1. Gathering Files

FP01: Guide of Moodle from task 1.4.a.

FP02: Your self-reflective post from task 1.4.b

## 2. File Types

You can only upload the following file types for this assignment:

- PDF
- GIF
- PNG
- JPG

## 3. Submitting

Now add your file(s), relax a bit, and your next course will open according to the dates in your progression plan. You can add the files as either one PDF or a PDF and an image. Feel free to socialize with fellow students on Discord. Good luck with your studies!
